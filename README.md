# GymController

##Intro
This is a personal project which was made in origin for my DAW course.

##This project is about...
Pretends to be a fitness center manager where people can reserve their classes, cancel their reservations and make other things like for example perform statistics (how many calories have you burned compared with your goal of calories).

##Developing
This project has been made with AngularJS 1, Javascript, HTML5 and Bootsrap 4.
For the backend it was implemented in origin for using Parse (www.parse.com). In the future this should change because the The hosted Parse service is now shut down.

##Contribuir
This is a free project where everybody can help.
